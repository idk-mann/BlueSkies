# üå§Ô∏è BlueSkies

**BlueSkies** is a modern Android weather app that delivers real-time forecasts, personalized notifications, and a clean Material 3 interface.  
It is built with **Kotlin**, **MVVM architecture**, and **Tomorrow.io API**.  

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Real-time weather data powered by **Tomorrow.io API**
- Forecast range: **1 to 7 days**
- Up to **10 personalized weather notifications** per day with user selected time
- **Map-based location picker** & city autocomplete (offline-capable with Room)
- **Dynamic theming**: sunrise, sunset, night, and day backgrounds based on the selected location
- **Dark/Light mode** support with Material 3

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Kotlin** + **Coroutines**  
- **Room Database** (city autocomplete, offline support)  
- **WorkManager** (scheduled notifications)  
- **RecyclerView** (weather card and etc)  
- **MVVM Architecture** (ViewModel, LiveData, Repository pattern)  
- **Tomorrow.io API** (real-time weather data)

## üöß Work in Progress

  Planned updates & improvements:
    Offline weather caching for network loss
    More flexible notifications (weekly & recurring)
      -Enable user to select each location for each personalized weather notification 
    Animated weather transitions (rain, sunrise, etc.)
    Add location UI improvements (better layout to improve sser-friendliness )
    Unit tests for repositories & ViewModels

## üåßÔ∏è Vision: Enhanced Localized Rain Prediction for Tropical Regions

In tropical countries like Malaysia, rain is often highly localized, sometimes affecting only a single neighborhood or area. 
Traditional weather models struggle to predict this kind of rainfall due to their broader scale and limited ground-level resolution.
To address this, I aim to improve in-house localized rain prediction by leveraging:
    A network of micro weather stations, built using affordable sensors like barometers, wind vanes, rain sensor and temperature/humidity sensors.
    Along with AI-powered cameras trained to classify cloud formations associated with imminent rain.
    Cameras also estimate cloud movement direction and speed, allowing predictions for surrounding areas as the weather evolves.
    Edge AI + Cloud Integration, where local devices process data in real time and sync with a central prediction engine.
    Machine learning models train specifically on tropical weather behavior, trained on hyperlocal data patterns combined with other sources such as .
This system can be scaled and adapted for cities and rural areas alike ‚Äî bringing real-time, street-level weather insights to users, 
delivery services, agriculture, and disaster management platforms.
